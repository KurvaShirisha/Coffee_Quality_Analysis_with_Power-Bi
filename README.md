# Coffee_Quality_Analysis_with_Power-Bi

## BUSINESS PROBLEM :
The coffee industry thrives on quality, and stakeholders are constantly seeking ways to understand and improve the factors that contribute to it. However, the complexity of coffee quality evaluation involves various sensory attributes, processing methods, origin regions, and defects, making it challenging to pinpoint the key determinants. Therefore, the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) aims to leverage its dataset to unravel these complexities and provide insights that can guide stakeholders in enhancing coffee quality standards.
## OBJECTIVE :
The primary objective is to delve into the dataset provided by CQI to decipher the factors influencing coffee quality. This involves:
Â 
Identifying the key determinants of coffee quality, focusing on sensory attributes like aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.
Exploring correlations between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores.
Analyzing trends or patterns in defect occurrences and their impact on overall coffee quality.
Understanding how different variables interact to influence Total Cup Points, which serve as an overall measure of coffee quality.

## Data Preparation

## Data Analysis

## INSIGHTS :
The overall coffee quality is 83.94 out of 100 based on various sensory evaluations.
All sensory evaluations of coffee quality are greater than 7.5, which is good for coffee.
The "Washed/wet" processing method has the highest total cup points compared to other methods, scoring 82.
The country of origin "Taiwan" has the highest processing method and quality score, followed by "Guatemala".
The "Washed/wet" processing method has the highest quality score despite having the maximum defects.
The country "Taiwan" has received the highest total cup points compared to others.
The harvest year of 2021 has received the maximum total cup points.
The September months have max quality score occurs compared to other months.

## DashBoard :

## Conclusion :
Through analysis, key determinants of coffee quality were identified, including aroma, flavor, acidity, body, and cleanliness. Processing methods and origin regions significantly influence quality, highlighting the importance of regional specificity and production techniques. Defect occurrences, both visible and taste-related, underscore the necessity of robust quality control measures. Complex interactions among variables emphasize the multifaceted nature of coffee quality determination. Leveraging data-driven approaches and consumer education can drive continuous quality improvement and sustainability in the coffee industry.
